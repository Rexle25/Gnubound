OpenGeoPuzzle is a lightweight open-source engine for creating and playing virtual treasure hunts directly in the browser.

I started this project because I was frustrated with how most virtual scavenger hunt platforms lock essential features behind paywalls and offer very little customization. OpenGeoPuzzle is my answer to that problem.

The entire project is completely free â€“ and it always will be.

Everything is currently in development and not playable. Check again in August.
