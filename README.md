OpenGeoPuzzle is a lightweight open-source engine for creating and playing virtual treasure hunts directly in the browser.

I started this project because I was frustrated with how most virtual scavenger hunt platforms lock essential features behind paywalls and offer very little customization. OpenGeoPuzzle is my answer to that problem.

I'm currently working on adding more features. For now, the engine supports:

    Info â€“ displays a simple text message

    Question â€“ requires the correct answer to proceed

    GPS â€“ gives you a hint, and you have to physically go to the correct location

Thereâ€™s also a JSON generator that helps you easily create your own custom hunt in a user-friendly way. Just paste your JSON into the input field and you're ready to go.

Progress is saved automatically in the browser. Everything runs client-side, with no need to install anything.

The entire project is completely free â€“ and it always will be.
